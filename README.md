## Description

This project was created to enable fast generation of QR codes for different ≈ÅuczniczQA's meetup resources.

After changing the hardcoded links (or adding new ones) it can be used to generate simple QR for any given resource.

## Plan for the future:

- Full refactor
- Links in the seperate file, not hardcoded in the code
- Possibility to put you own link in the command line
- GUI?
